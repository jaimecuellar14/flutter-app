# internetstores

My implementation using flutter.

## Getting started

First of all I want to thank you for keeping me in mind for the position as mobile developver.
I created this app using Flutter mainly for two reasons, I wanted to learn something new in my free time during the quarantine and also to work with the tech that is used on internetstores.

I had fun doing the app and realized how useful and fast it is to work with flutter. I decided to work with the file but also implement a solution using firebase, why firebase? I read that works good with flutter and its a backend easy to implement.

### Installation

You can clone the repo and run the application directly into your device or you can download the `.apk` from this drive link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bu4cC6DtHl2Ir-O_LcPvgc4UNCa46pDm
